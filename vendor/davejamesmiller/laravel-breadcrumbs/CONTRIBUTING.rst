 Support & Contribution Guidelines
################################################################################

.. This file is for GitHub (https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines)

Please submit support requests, bug reports, feature requests and pull requests using `GitHub issues <https://github.com/davejamesmiller/laravel-breadcrumbs/issues>`_.

All **support requests / bug reports** should include the following:

- The complete error message, including file & line numbers
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Laravel Breadcrumbs version
- Laravel version
- PHP version

You should also include copies of the following where appropriate:

- ``app/Http/breadcrumbs.php``
- ``config/breadcrumbs.php`` (if used)
- The view or layout that outputs the breadcrumbs
- The custom breadcrumbs template (if applicable)
- The ``providers`` and ``aliases`` sections of ``config/app.php`` (Note: **not the Encryption Key section** which should be kept private) -- in case there's a conflict with another package
- Any other relevant files

**Note:** Don't be afraid to go into the Laravel Breadcrumbs code and use ``var_dump()`` (or ``print_r()``) to see what's happening and try to fix your own problems! A pull request or detailed bug report is much more likely to get attention than a vague error report. Also make sure you read the `documentation <http://laravel-breadcrumbs.davejamesmiller.com/en/latest/>`_ carefully.

Any **feature requests / pull requests** should include details of what you are trying to achieve (use case) to explain why your request should be implemented.

.. This text is also in docs/contributing.rst
If you want to submit a **bug fix**, please make your changes in a new branch (based on the ``develop`` branch), then open a `pull request <https://github.com/davejamesmiller/laravel-breadcrumbs/pulls>`_. (The `Contributing page of the docs <http://laravel-breadcrumbs.davejamesmiller.com/en/latest/contributing.html>`_ may help you to get started if you've not done this before.)

.. This text is also in docs/contributing.rst
If you want to submit a **new feature**, it's usually best to open an `issue <https://github.com/davejamesmiller/laravel-breadcrumbs/issues>`_ to discuss the idea first -- to make sure it will be accepted before spending too much time on it. (Of course you can go ahead and develop it first if you prefer!) Please be sure to update the documentation as well.

If you have any suggestions for improving the **documentation** -- especially if anything is unclear to you and could be explained better -- please let me know. (Or just edit it yourself and make a pull request.)
